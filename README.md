# Hi there! I'm Colin ðŸ‘‹

I am a Year 3 Undergraduate studying Business and Commputer Science in Nanyang Technological University!

My interests in Computer Science lies in Software Development. I was able to take charge of many projects to develop innovative web and mobile applications during my years in NTU, and am looking to expand in this area to help companies develop Software solutions!

This Github page is currently in progress and I intend to showcase more about myself and my computer science projects on the website.

## Thanks for reading!
